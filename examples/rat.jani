# âš  This PowerShell code will not obfuscate, thus it's not recommended to use in production.
#    This is because, in the current state of JANI, PowerShell bindings are not parsed.
#    That said, it's rather a PoC (Proof of Concept) that can be learned from, or used in
#      urgent (*education-only*) cases.

# Also I know this code looks like fucking c++ well uhh
# Maybe i'll fix it later
# By fixing it i mean adding more things to the language and improving the default library because it's all ass rn
